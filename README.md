## Prescription Reminders App

This was a final project for a university course on Human-Computer Interactions in Healthcare. The goals of the project were to design/improve a healthcare-related human-computer interfact based on the results of a usability study that we were to conduct with participants in our personal lives. An initial demo of the project was presented to the class, and modifications were to be implemented based on feedback from classmates and the course instructor, that were then to be presented in a final demo of the project.

This mobile app was designed using React Native and Firebase as the database. The app also employs OCR technology by consuming Google Vision API to obtain information about prescription bottle images provided by the user.
